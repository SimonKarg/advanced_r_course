## Working in RMarkdown

Rmarkdown is a powerful tool for combining code, text, and visualizations in a single document. It allows you to create documents that are reproducible, dynamic, and interactive. 

There's a ton of stuff to learn with rmarkdown. Get inspiration [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html)

## Brief intro to RMarkdown

Rmarkdown documents have 3 basic ingredients

-   *a YAML header* - specifying general output options
-   *Text in markdown format* - any explanatory text you like to add, e.g. documentation
-   *Code chunks* - your R code (can also run python, Stan, ...)

## Work with an example

open up `example_rmd_file.Rmd` and `example_rmd_file.html`
