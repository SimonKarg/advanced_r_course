## Pick one {.smaller .scrollable}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

##### **Work on an existing R project** and make it more reproducible, ideas include:

-   comment your code
-   include `sessionInfo()`
-   try out the {renv} package
-   organize your files in a consistent structure
-   send your code to your neighbour, see if they can understand it, run it?

::: {.column width="50%"}

#####  Start a new R project

-   Get some data to work with - My suggestion: [tidytuesday squirrel data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-05-23/readme.md)
-   Build an .rmd / .qmd document (your choice)
-   Do some data exploration (cleaning, plotting, ...)
-   Add some tabbed content
-   try out the {renv} package
-   ...

Get the squirrel data like this
```{r}
#| eval: false
squirrel_data <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-05-23/squirrel_data.csv')
```
