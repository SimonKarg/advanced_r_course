Constructive elements imply a prosocial attitude, signaling the disapproval of hate or hostile behavior, or posts that aim to side with, shield or comfort an individual victim or victimized group. In other words, the post tries to establish or restore favorable conditions for civil political discussion online (either in the short or the long term). 
Note that the mere labelling of someone as a racist, white supremacist, liar, …, without backing up these statements with information about why this accusation is deserved should not count as constructive. For example: “Politician X is a racist” is not constructive, whereas “This law is racist because it will affect black people differently from white people” would count as constructive.

Depending on whom they address (victim of hate, perpetrator of hate, larger audience), constructive posts may take the following forms:
  
  Towards victims of hate:
  -	Expressing support (“I am with you”, “I am here”, “DMs are always open if you want to talk”, “I am so sorry you have to experience this”)
-	Shielding (“Don’t listen to this jerk”)
-	Offering advice (“this is over the line. Don’t feel bad about reporting people that act like this”)

Towards perpetrators of hate:
  -	trying to educate authors of a hateful post by providing facts that counter the hateful message (e.g. “this is actually not correct, the xxx clearly states that …”), in a sincere and non-ironic manner.
-	Pointing out inconsistencies by asking questions, in a Socratic manner, “If you think this is true, do you also think that ... is true?”  
-	warning them of consequences of hateful messages (e.g., “your comment is against platform regulations! Be careful, or your account might get deleted”, “blocked and reported”)
-	trying to get perpetrators to empathize with the target of their hate (e.g., “this is hurtful to xxx”)
-	calling out hate speech, but note mere labelling exception detailed above (e.g. “this is racism”, “this is hatespeech”, …)
-	appealing to a shared trait, e.g. common humanity, equal rights (“we’re all human”, …)

Towards the general public audience:
  -	Calling for a better culture of debate (e.g., “Let’s keep things civil and informative on here”)
