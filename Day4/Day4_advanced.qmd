Day 4: Advanced R Programming 



--> Draw inspiration from Advanced R:

    In Section 6.2.3, you learned about Râ€™s first-class functions. In R, you bind a function to a name in the same way as you bind any object to a name: with <-.

    In Section 7.4.2, you learned that a function captures (encloses) the environment in which it is created.

    In Section 7.4.4, you learned that a function creates a new execution environment every time it is run. This environment is usually ephemeral, but here it becomes the enclosing environment of the manufactured function.
